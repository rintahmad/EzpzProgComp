# EzpzProgComp

This repo will not have much explanation but will be use to store any tricks and solutions for any programing questions whether local or international events.

I want to improve on different programming languages, so this repo would have different solutions consists of:

- Python
- C
- C++
- Node JS
- Rust (Hopefully)

Feels free to refer and let's learn together :)

## Python

```bash
# Input
arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
x,y = map(int,input().split())
x = int(input())
M = list(map(int,input().split()))

# One Liner
print("boleh") if (x % 2 == 0) and (x > 5) else print("tidak boleh")

# Sort List & Sum (Top 5)
sum(sorted(M)[-5:])

# Floor Div
x = 6 // 4
```
